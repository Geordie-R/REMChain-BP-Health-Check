# REMChain-BP-Health-Check

<p>Unfinished but working to an extent, this is an attempt to detect if a BP is capable of atomic swapping by watching for the init action on the rem.swap account.  We will then grab a list of active producers and then create a JSON list of Active producers and a true/false if they have been seen creating init transactions within the last <time period> hours.</p>
